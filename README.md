# code2040-TechAssessment

Taking the code 2040 challenge was definetly not an easy task for me. In order to finish this effectivley, I learned the basics of Python and implemented it into the challenge. As for API's, I have had previous experience with that ans JSON so this project was a good way to refresh my memory and practice it some more. I hope that this challenge is another step forward to getting a summer internship.
